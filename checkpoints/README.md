# DualLAAT Checkpoints

- `DualLAAT-ckpt-1`: DualLAAT trained on frequent code set
- `DualLAAT-ckpt-2`: DualLAAT trained on full code set
- `DualLAAT-cnn`: DualLAAT with CNN encoder trained on full code set

All models are trained using the three MIMIC benchmark training sets and two synthetic datasets on ICD-10.
